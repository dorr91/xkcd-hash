This is a Java project for bruteforcing the hash provided by XKCD (xkcd.com/1193) at almamater.xkcd.com.
Run with 
	java -jar xkcd-hash.jar <numthreads>
This will print and submit to http://almamater.xkcd.com/?edu=cmu.edu every hash it finds that is a new 
best, per thread (coordinating across threads seemed like a lot of overhead).
On every million hash, it also prints the total hashes so far and the average hash speed since starting.

Throughput:
A single thread on a 3.84ghz AMD phenom II x6 processor checks ~21000 hashes/sec.
Six threads on 6 cores saw throughput of ~17000 hashes/sec per thread.

Unfortunately, this does not compare favorably with a similar C implementation, which achieves nearly a million hashes/sec, single-threaded. Oh well.
